# Lithium (Speedcubing training software)
Training software that can be used to practice specific steps of solving multiple variants of the Rubik's cube.

## Main to-do List
- [x] Support for skewb L2L (Main purpose)
- [ ] Support for 2x2x2 (Ortega, EG, TCLL)
- [x] Ability to see the best algs for cases (Provided in file, has to be manually updated by redownloading, people can contribute via pull requests)
- [x] Ability to select / add your own algs for cases
- [x] On the spot generated scrambles for cases (brute-forcing for smaller cubes)
- [x] Timer to train algs
- [x] Visualizer for the cases

## Smaller things
- [ ] Save times to get an average idea of how slow you are
- [ ] Save times per alg to see which algs are best / worst for you
- [ ] Save times per case to see which cases are slowest
- [ ] Why not add an on the spot alg generator as well, if you feel like all algs are bad.
