# Lithium (Speedcubing training software)
Training software that can be used to practice specific steps of solving variants of the Rubik's cube.

## Main to-do List
- [x] Support for skewb L2L (Main purpose)
- [ ] Support for skewb EG2
- [x] Support for 2x2x2 (EG, TCLL, LS)
- [x] On the spot generated scrambles for cases (brute-forcing for smaller cubes)
- [x] Timer to train algs
- [x] 1-look trainer for skewb
- [x] Image generator for skewb
- [ ] Image generator for 2x2
- [x] Alg generator for 2x2
- [ ] Allow for saving presets of set-combinations for the algtrainer
- [ ] Alg-train in elimination mode (discard seen cases until sets are empty)

## Postponed to later
- [ ] Dynamic visualizer for the cases

## Perhaps useful
- [ ] Save times to get an average idea of how slow you are
- [ ] Save times per alg to see which algs are best / worst for you
- [ ] Save times per case to see which cases are slowest
- [ ] Ability to select / add your own algs for cases
